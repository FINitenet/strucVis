AUTHOR

REQUIREMENTS
    perl5 (installed at /usr/bin/perl)

    samtools (installed in your PATH)

    RNAfold (installed in your PATH)

USAGE
        strucVis -b [bam] -g [genome] -c [Chr:start-stop] -s [strand 'plus' or 'minus'] -p [output.ps]

INPUTS
    -b : path to sorted and indexed BAM alignment file of small RNAs

    -g : path to FASTA formatted reference genome. Must be indexed using
    samtools faidx.

    -c : Coordinates of interest in format Chr:start-stop.

    -s : Strand of interest. Either 'plus' or 'minus'.

    -p : Output postscript file name. Must end in .ps

OUTPUT
    The text-based output of RNAfold is sent to STDOUT along with a
    text-based 'read cloud' of all aligned reads. The annotated post-script
    file goes to the file indicated by -p.

CHANGELOG
  version 0.2
    Added 'read cloud' print-out of all reads.

    Restricted input alignments to be used to only include primary
    alignments without indels, introns, clipping, or padding.

  version 0.1
    First release
